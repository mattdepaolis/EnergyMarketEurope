## Summary
In 2021, a historic surge was observed in electricity prices across Europe. A quantitative assessment reveals a 250% increase in the cost of electricity from January onwards, with a 70% hike observed from August alone. There are multifarious explanations provided for this unprecedented rise. 
Notably, the winter season in Europe was significantly colder than the norm, resulting in an under-average refill of natural gas storage facilities. Concurrently, an unusually warm climatic condition in Asia stimulated an increased usage of natural gas to power air conditioning systems. In the same time span, the export of gas from Russia to Northern Europe experienced a downturn. The amalgamation of these contributing factors led to a disruption in the equilibrium between supply and demand of fossil fuels intended for energy generation (BBC, 2021). 

The main objective of this research thesis is to explore the degree to which variations in the prices of distinctive fossil fuels can influence the cost of electricity in Europe. Specifically, the study will focus on the prices of natural gas and crude oil. 
As a benchmark for electricity prices, the German electricity market is selected due to its status as the largest and most liquid market in Europe. For the examination of natural gas prices, the Dutch "Title Transfer Facility" is selected since it acts as the European benchmark for natural gas. In the case of oil prices, the variants "Brent" and "WTI" are chosen for analysis, as they represent the most extensively traded varieties. The price data under investigation pertains to future prices slated for the year 2022.
